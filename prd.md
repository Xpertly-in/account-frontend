---

## 5. File Naming Conventions & Structure

### Naming Conventions

- **React Components in features/layout:** Files containing React components must be named using PascalCase with a `.component.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `Header.component.tsx`, `CACard.component.tsx`
- **UI Components:** Base UI components must be named using PascalCase with a `.ui.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `Button.ui.tsx`, `Card.ui.tsx`
- **Provider Components:** Provider components must be named using PascalCase with a `.provider.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `Auth.provider.tsx`, `Theme.provider.tsx`
- **Helper Functions:** Helper functions must be stored in the `/helper` directory with a `.helper.ts` extension.
  - Example: `tw.helper.ts`, `supabase.helper.ts`
- **Types/Interfaces:** Type definitions must be stored in the `/types` directory with a `.type.ts` extension.
  - Example: `ca.type.ts`
- **Constants:** Constant values must be stored in the `/constants` directory.

### Directory Structure

The project follows a domain-based approach to file organization:

```
src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ app/           # Next.js App Router pages
  â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # React components
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/    # Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ leads/     # Lead management components
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/  # Feature-specific components
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [domain]/  # Domain-specific components grouped by business functionality
  â”œâ”€â”€ ui/            # Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)

  â”œâ”€â”€ tests/         # Test files following domain-based structure
  â””â”€â”€ mock/          # Mock data for development
```

### Services Layer Architecture

The project implements a clear separation between helper functions and data fetching operations:

#### Services Layer (`/services`)

- **Purpose**: Handle all data fetching, API communication, and external service integration
- **Naming Convention**: `entityName.service.ts` (camelCase)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Database queries and mutations
  - API calls to external services
  - Data transformation between external and internal formats
  - Error handling for data operations
- **Examples**: `leads.service.ts`, `auth.service.ts`, `profile.service.ts`

#### Helper Layer (`/helper`)

- **Purpose**: Provide utility functions and common operations (NO data fetching)
- **Naming Convention**: `entityName.helper.ts` (camelCase)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Pure utility functions
  - Data formatting and validation
  - Common calculations
  - Client-side operations
- **Examples**: `tw.helper.ts`, `date.helper.ts`, `validation.helper.ts`

#### Key Architectural Rules

1. **Services handle data, helpers handle utilities**
2. **No data fetching operations in helper files**
3. **Services should be the only layer communicating with external APIs/databases**
4. **Helpers should contain pure functions without side effects**
5. **Both services and helpers should have comprehensive test coverage**

### Testing Structure

Tests follow the same domain-based organization as the source code:

#### Test Organization

- **Component Tests**: Mirror the component structure

  - `src/components/leads/LeadCard.component.tsx` â†’ `src/tests/components/leads/LeadCard.test.tsx`
  - `src/components/features/auth/LoginForm.component.tsx` â†’ `src/tests/components/features/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx`

- **Service Tests**: Test data fetching and API operations

  - `src/services/leads.service.ts` â†’ `src/tests/services/leads.test.ts`
  - `src/services/auth.service.ts` â†’ `src/tests/services/auth.test.ts`

- **Helper Tests**: Test utility functions
  - `src/helper/date.helper.ts` â†’ `src/tests/helper/date.test.ts`
  - `src/helper/validation.helper.ts` â†’ `src/tests/helper/validation.test.ts`

#### Test Naming Conventions

- Component tests: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Service tests: `serviceName.test.ts`
- Helper tests: `helperName.test.ts`
- Store tests: `storeName.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Services**: 100% coverage (critical for data integrity)
- **Components**: 90%+ coverage (UI reliability)
- **Helpers**: 100% coverage (utility function reliability)
- **Store**: 90%+ coverage (state management reliability)

## 6. Design & Technical Constraints

- **Mobile-First Design:**

  - All pages and components must be designed initially for mobile devices, then progressively enhanced for larger screens.
  - Define responsive breakpoints in the TailwindCSS configuration.
  - Ensure proper padding scales with screen size (more padding on larger screens).
  - Set appropriate max-width constraints to prevent content from stretching too wide on large screens.

- **Visual Design Requirements:**

  - **Vibrant and Bold Design:** Use gradients, shadows, and visual effects to create a visually appealing interface.
  - **Card Components:** Feature cards should have gradient headers, visual icons, and interactive hover effects.
  - **Depth and Dimension:** Utilize shadows, overlays, and subtle animations to add depth to the interface.
  - **Color Gradient Accents:** Use gradient backgrounds for section headers and CTA areas.
  - **Interactive Elements:** Add hover states that provide visual feedback through transforms, shadow changes, and color shifts.
  - **Visual Patterns:** Incorporate subtle background patterns and decorative elements to add texture without overwhelming.

- **Component Modularity:**

  - Every component should be **under 200 lines of code** to ensure modularity and maintainability.

- **TailwindCSS Theme Configuration:**

  - A Tailwind configuration file must be created, including our established color palette (see Section 7 below).
  - The theme should include the primary (deep blue), secondary (lighter blue), accent (emerald green), and neutral color styles.
  - Utilize TailwindCSS utility classes for consistent spacing, shadows, and interactive effects.

- **Iconography:**

  - Use **Phosphor Icons** exclusively for all icon needs throughout the application.
  - Maintain icon consistency in size, style, and color schemes.
  - Icons should be properly sized for touch targets on mobile devices.

- **Placeholder Assets:**

  - Use a placeholder component for the logo until the brand identity is finalized.

- **AI Agent Context Requirements:**
  - The AI agent (Cursor) must remain fully aware of the context through inline comments, `progress.md` updates, and a dedicated rules file.
  - The rules file (either `cursor_rules.md` or a JSON configuration) should lay out the mobile-first design approach, component size limits, and guidelines for updating progress.

---

## 7. TailwindCSS Configuration & Theme Colors

- **Task for Tailwind Configuration:**

  - Add a task to set up `tailwind.config.js` that includes our color palette:

    - **Primary:** Deep Blue (`#1E3A8A`)
    - **Secondary:** Lighter Blue (`#3B82F6`)
    - **Accent:** Emerald Green (`#10B981`)
    - **Neutrals:** White (`#FFFFFF`), Light Gray (`#F3F4F6`), Dark Slate (`#1F2937`), Muted Gray (`#6B7280`)

  - Ensure the configuration reflects mobile-first breakpoints and supports our design system.

## 8. State Management Guidelines

### 8.1 Jotai Implementation

The project uses Jotai for state management, following these strict guidelines:

- **File Organization:**

  - All store-related code MUST be in the `/store/jotai` directory
  - Store files must use the `.store.ts` extension (e.g., `analytics.store.ts`, `onboarding.store.ts`)
  - Type definitions MUST be in dedicated type files in the `/types` directory

- **Import Patterns:**

  - Use `jotai/vanilla` for atom creation
  - Use `jotai/react` for React-specific hooks
  - Import all Jotai functionality from centralized exports in `src/store/jotai/index.ts`

- **Critical Rules:**

  - NO new providers should be created
  - NO duplication of type definitions in store files
  - Store files should only contain atom definitions, not type definitions
  - Maintain correct separation between server and client components when using Jotai

- **Structuring Atoms:**

  - Group related atoms in the same file
  - Use meaningful, consistent naming with the `Atom` suffix (e.g., `userProfileAtom`)
  - Follow a standard organization: base atoms first, then derived atoms, then action atoms

- **Avoiding Common Issues:**
  - Always update imports when renaming files to prevent "module not found" errors
  - Do not create atom instances outside of store files
  - Maintain state tracking integrity when refactoring
  - Prevent "multiple Jotai instances" error through proper import patterns

These guidelines must be strictly followed to maintain code quality and prevent state management issues.

### 8.2 Domain-Based Component Organization

The project follows a domain-based approach to component organization to ensure modularity and maintainability:

#### Organization Philosophy

The codebase is organized by business domain rather than technical function, which offers several advantages:

1. **Domain Cohesion:** Components related to the same business domain are grouped together, making the codebase more intuitive to navigate.
2. **Reduced Coupling:** Each domain has clear boundaries, reducing dependencies between unrelated features.
3. **Team Ownership:** Enables teams to take ownership of entire domains without stepping on each other's work.
4. **Scalability:** As the application grows, new domains can be added without reorganizing existing code.

#### Implementation

- Components are grouped by their business domain rather than their technical purpose
- Major domains have dedicated directories under `/src/components/`
- Example domains include:
  - `/components/leads/` - Components related to lead management
  - `/components/auth/` - Authentication-related components
  - `/components/forum/` - Forum and community components

#### Migration Example

The project recently migrated from a technical organization (`/components/dashboard/LeadCard.component.tsx`) to a domain-based organization (`/components/leads/LeadCard.component.tsx`). This reorganization:

1. Improved code discoverability by placing all lead-related components in one location
2. Enhanced maintainability by grouping related components
3. Established a pattern for future feature development
4. Clarified component ownership and purpose

#### Component Directory Structure

- **Layout Components:**
  - `Container.component.tsx`
- **UI Components:**
  - `Button.ui.tsx`, `Input.ui.tsx`, `Card.ui.tsx`, `Avatar.ui.tsx`, `Checkbox.ui.tsx`, `Logo.ui.tsx`, `ThemeToggle.ui.tsx`, `DecorativeElements.ui.tsx`, `CheckboxGroup.ui.tsx`, `FileUpload.ui.tsx`, `Switch.ui.tsx`, `Textarea.ui.tsx`, `Select.ui.tsx`, `AuthDivider.ui.tsx`, `GoogleButton.ui.tsx`, `BackButton.ui.tsx`
- **Feature Components:**
  - `LoginForm.component.tsx`, `LoginFormFields.component.tsx`, `LoginFormSecurity.component.tsx`, `SignUpForm.component.tsx`, `SignUpFormContent.component.tsx`, `CAAuthTabs.component.tsx`, `SearchBar.component.tsx`, `CACard.component.tsx`, `Leads.component.tsx`, `LeadCard.component.tsx`, `LeadFilter.component.tsx`, `LeadSkeleton.component.tsx`, `LeadEmptyState.component.tsx`, `RoleSelection.component.tsx`, `UserOnboardingForm.component.tsx`, `ForumFeed.component.tsx`, `PostCard.component.tsx`, `ReactionSystem.component.tsx`, `CommentThread.component.tsx`, `CreatePost.component.tsx`, `SearchAndFilter.component.tsx`, `DashboardLayout.component.tsx`

#### Best Practices

- When adding new components, identify the business domain first, then place in the appropriate directory
- If a component is used across multiple domains, consider if it belongs in a shared directory
- Keep all tests aligned with the domain structure to maintain consistency
- Update documentation whenever domain organization changes

## 9. Development Environment & Contextual Awareness

- **Using Cursor IDE:**
  - **Context Management:** Every file should include inline comments that reference the mobile-first design philosophy and the 200-line rule.
  - **Progress Tracking:**
    - Create and continually update a `progress.md` file after each completed task or sub-task.
    - This file is critical for ensuring that work can be resumed seamlessly if interruptions occur.
- **Cursor Rules Storage:**
  - **Recommendation:**
    - After researching best practices, it is acceptable to store the Cursor rules in a dedicated Markdown file (`cursor_rules.md`) for human readability.
    - For enhanced machine parsing, consider also including a JSON configuration file (e.g., `.cursor_rules.json`) in the project root.
  - **Guidelines in the Rules File:**
    - Mobile-first design mandates.
    - Maximum of 200 lines per component.
    - Detailed instructions for updating `progress.md` after every task.
    - Consistent usage of Next.js, TailwindCSS, shadcn UI components, react-query, and phosphoricons.

_Example Entry in `cursor_rules.md` or `.cursor_rules.json`:_
Rule 1: All components must follow a mobile-first approach. Rule 2: No component should exceed 200 lines of code. Rule 3: Update progress.md after every task/sub-task with detailed context. Rule 4: Use Next.js, TailwindCSS (with the defined theme colors), shadcn UI components, react-query, and phosphoricons. ...

    - [x] Ensure `DynamicForm`

## Code Organization

### TypeScript Type System Standards

The project follows these type system standards:

1. **Type Definitions**:

   - All component props must have explicit type definitions
   - All data models must have interface definitions
   - All functions must have explicit return types and parameter types

2. **Enum Pattern**:

   - Enums MUST be defined in type files (e.g., `*.type.ts`)
   - Enums should be used for all string-based type values like status, categories, or actions
   - Example: `enum LeadStatus { NEW = "new", CONTACTED = "contacted" }`

3. **Constants Pattern**:

   - String constants for UI labels, messages, and other display text MUST be in constants files (e.g., `*.constants.ts`)
   - Constants should use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
   - Example: `export const VALIDATION_MESSAGES = { REQUIRED: "This field is required" }`

4. **File Naming Conventions**:
   - React component files must be named: `ComponentName.component.tsx` (PascalCase)
   - Interface/type files must be named: `entityName.type.ts` (camelCase)
   - Constants files must be named: `entityName.constants.ts` (camelCase)
   - Utility files must be named: `entityName.utils.ts` (camelCase)

These standards ensure code consistency, reduce typos in string values, and improve maintainability.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Modular Testing Structure

The project follows a modular approach to testing that separates concerns and improves maintainability:

#### Test Mock Organization

- **Core Mocks (`/tests/mocks/core/`):**

  - `navigation.mock.tsx` - Next.js navigation (usePathname, useRouter, etc.)
  - `next.mock.tsx` - Next.js components (Link, Image, Script)
  - `storage.mock.ts` - Web storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
  - `window.mock.ts` - Window globals (matchMedia, ResizeObserver, etc.)
  - `analytics.mock.ts` - Analytics functions and hooks
  - `supabase.mock.ts` - Supabase client, auth, and database

- **State Management Mocks (`/tests/mocks/state/`):**

  - `jotai.mock.ts` - Jotai atoms and state management
  - `context.mock.tsx` - React context providers (Auth, Theme, etc.)

- **UI Component Mocks (`/tests/mocks/ui/`):**

  - `shadcn.mock.tsx` - shadcn UI components
  - `phosphor.mock.tsx` - Phosphor icon library

- **Feature-specific Mocks (`/tests/mocks/features/`):**
  - `dashboard.mock.tsx` - Dashboard-specific test helpers

#### Import Patterns

Tests should import mocks from the most specific location possible:

```typescript
// Good: Targeted imports
import { createNavigationMocks } from "@/tests/mocks/core/navigation.mock";
import { createJotaiMocks } from "@/tests/mocks/state/jotai.mock";

// Less ideal: Using the compatibility layer
import { createNavigationMocks, createJotaiMocks } from "@/tests/mocks/jestMock.helper";
```

For backward compatibility, all mock functions are re-exported from `jestMock.helper.tsx`.

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Component Testing:**

   - Each component should have a dedicated test file
   - Tests should verify both appearance and behavior
   - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Test Coverage Requirements:**

   - UI components: 100% coverage (statements, branches, functions)
   - Utility functions: 100% coverage (statements, branches, functions)
   - Pages and containers: Min. 80% coverage

3. **Accessibility Testing:**

   - All components should include accessibility tests
   - Use jest-axe for automated accessibility checks
   - Test keyboard navigation where applicable

4. **Test File Organization:**
   - Mirror the source code directory structure
   - Group tests by feature/functionality
   - Use descriptive test names
