---

## 5. File Naming Conventions & Structure

### Naming Conventions

- **React Components in features/layout:** Files containing React components must be named using PascalCase with a `.component.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `Header.component.tsx`, `CACard.component.tsx`
- **UI Components:** Base UI components must be named using PascalCase with a `.ui.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `Button.ui.tsx`, `Card.ui.tsx`
- **Provider Components:** Provider components must be named using PascalCase with a `.provider.tsx` extension.
  - Example: `Auth.provider.tsx`, `Theme.provider.tsx`
- **Helper Functions:** Helper functions must be stored in the `/helper` directory with a `.helper.ts` extension.
  - Example: `tw.helper.ts`, `supabase.helper.ts`
- **Types/Interfaces:** Type definitions must be stored in the `/types` directory with a `.type.ts` extension.
  - Example: `ca.type.ts`
- **Constants:** Constant values must be stored in the `/constants` directory.

### Directory Structure

The project follows a domain-based approach to file organization:

```
src/
  ├── app/           # Next.js App Router pages
  ├── components/    # React components
  │   ├── layout/    # Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)

```

### Services Layer Architecture

The project implements a clear separation between helper functions and data fetching operations:

#### Services Layer (`/services`)

- **Purpose**: Handle all data fetching, API communication, and external service integration
- **Naming Convention**: `entityName.service.ts` (camelCase)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Database queries and mutations
  - API calls to external services
  - Data transformation between external and internal formats
  - Error handling for data operations
- **Examples**: `leads.service.ts`, `auth.service.ts`, `profile.service.ts`

#### Helper Layer (`/helper`)

- **Purpose**: Provide utility functions and common operations (NO data fetching)
- **Naming Convention**: `entityName.helper.ts` (camelCase)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Pure utility functions
  - Data formatting and validation
  - Common calculations
  - Client-side operations
- **Examples**: `tw.helper.ts`, `date.helper.ts`, `validation.helper.ts`

#### Key Architectural Rules

1. **Services handle data, helpers handle utilities**
2. **No data fetching operations in helper files**
3. **Services should be the only layer communicating with external APIs/databases**
4. **Helpers should contain pure functions without side effects**
5. **Both services and helpers should have comprehensive test coverage**

### Testing Structure

Tests follow the same domain-based organization as the source code:

#### Test Organization

- **Component Tests**: Mirror the component structure

  - `src/components/leads/LeadCard.component.tsx` → `src/tests/components/leads/LeadCard.test.tsx`
  - `src/components/features/auth/LoginForm.component.tsx` → `src/tests/components/features/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx`

- **Service Tests**: Test data fetching and API operations

  - `src/services/leads.service.ts` → `src/tests/services/leads.test.ts`
  - `src/services/auth.service.ts` → `src/tests/services/auth.test.ts`

- **Helper Tests**: Test utility functions
  - `src/helper/date.helper.ts` → `src/tests/helper/date.test.ts`
  - `src/helper/validation.helper.ts` → `src/tests/helper/validation.test.ts`

#### Test Naming Conventions

- Component tests: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Service tests: `serviceName.test.ts`
- Helper tests: `helperName.test.ts`
- Store tests: `storeName.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Services**: 100% coverage (critical for data integrity)
- **Components**: 90%+ coverage (UI reliability)
- **Helpers**: 100% coverage (utility function reliability)
- **Store**: 90%+ coverage (state management reliability)

## 6. Design & Technical Constraints

- **Mobile-First Design:**

  - All pages and components must be designed initially for mobile devices, then progressively enhanced for larger screens.
  - Define responsive breakpoints in the TailwindCSS configuration.
  - Ensure proper padding scales with screen size (more padding on larger screens).
  - Set appropriate max-width constraints to prevent content from stretching too wide on large screens.

- **Visual Design Requirements:**

  - **Vibrant and Bold Design:** Use gradients, shadows, and visual effects to create a visually appealing interface.
  - **Card Components:** Feature cards should have gradient headers, visual icons, and interactive hover effects.
  - **Depth and Dimension:** Utilize shadows, overlays, and subtle animations to add depth to the interface.
  - **Color Gradient Accents:** Use gradient backgrounds for section headers and CTA areas.
  - **Interactive Elements:** Add hover states that provide visual feedback through transforms, shadow changes, and color shifts.
  - **Visual Patterns:** Incorporate subtle background patterns and decorative elements to add texture without overwhelming.

- **Component Modularity:**

  - Every component should be **under 200 lines of code** to ensure modularity and maintainability.

- **TailwindCSS Theme Configuration:**

  - A Tailwind configuration file must be created, including our established color palette (see Section 7 below).
  - The theme should include the primary (deep blue), secondary (lighter blue), accent (emerald green), and neutral color styles.
  - Utilize TailwindCSS utility classes for consistent spacing, shadows, and interactive effects.

- **Iconography:**

  - Use **Phosphor Icons** exclusively for all icon needs throughout the application.
  - **Icon Import Pattern**: All icons must be imported with the "Icon" suffix (e.g., `import { UserIcon, CameraIcon } from "@phosphor-icons/react"`).
  - Maintain icon consistency in size, style, and color schemes.
  - Icons should be properly sized for touch targets on mobile devices.

- **Placeholder Assets:**

  - Use a placeholder component for the logo until the brand identity is finalized.

- **AI Agent Context Requirements:**
  - The AI agent (Cursor) must remain fully aware of the context through inline comments, `progress.md` updates, and a dedicated rules file.
  - The rules file (either `cursor_rules.md` or a JSON configuration) should lay out the mobile-first design approach, component size limits, and guidelines for updating progress.

---

## 7. TailwindCSS Configuration & Theme Colors

- **Task for Tailwind Configuration:**

  - Add a task to set up `tailwind.config.js` that includes our color palette:

    - **Primary:** Deep Blue (`#1E3A8A`)
    - **Secondary:** Lighter Blue (`#3B82F6`)
    - **Accent:** Emerald Green (`#10B981`)
    - **Neutrals:** White (`#FFFFFF`), Light Gray (`#F3F4F6`), Dark Slate (`#1F2937`), Muted Gray (`#6B7280`)

  - Ensure the configuration reflects mobile-first breakpoints and supports our design system.

## 8. State Management Guidelines

### 8.1 Jotai Implementation

The project uses Jotai for state management, following these strict guidelines:

- **File Organization:**

  - All store-related code MUST be in the `/store/jotai` directory
  - Store files must use the `.store.ts` extension (e.g., `analytics.store.ts`, `onboarding.store.ts`)
  - Type definitions MUST be in dedicated type files in the `/types` directory

- **Import Patterns:**

  - Use `jotai/vanilla` for atom creation
  - Use `jotai/react` for React-specific hooks
  - Import all Jotai functionality from centralized exports in `src/store/jotai/index.ts`

- **Critical Rules:**

  - NO new providers should be created
  - NO duplication of type definitions in store files
  - Store files should only contain atom definitions, not type definitions
  - Maintain correct separation between server and client components when using Jotai

- **Structuring Atoms:**

  - Group related atoms in the same file
  - Use meaningful, consistent naming with the `Atom` suffix (e.g., `userProfileAtom`)
  - Follow a standard organization: base atoms first, then derived atoms, then action atoms

- **Avoiding Common Issues:**
  - Always update imports when renaming files to prevent "module not found" errors
  - Do not create atom instances outside of store files
  - Maintain state tracking integrity when refactoring
  - Prevent "multiple Jotai instances" error through proper import patterns

These guidelines must be strictly followed to maintain code quality and prevent state management issues.

### 8.2 Domain-Based Component Organization

The project follows a domain-based approach to component organization to ensure modularity and maintainability:

#### Organization Philosophy

The codebase is organized by business domain rather than technical function, which offers several advantages:

1. **Domain Cohesion:** Components related to the same business domain are grouped together, making the codebase more intuitive to navigate.
2. **Reduced Coupling:** Each domain has clear boundaries, reducing dependencies between unrelated features.
3. **Team Ownership:** Enables teams to take ownership of entire domains without stepping on each other's work.
4. **Scalability:** As the application grows, new domains can be added without reorganizing existing code.

#### Implementation

- Components are grouped by their business domain rather than their technical purpose
- Major domains have dedicated directories under `/src/components/`
- Example domains include:
  - `/components/leads/` - Components related to lead management
  - `/components/auth/` - Authentication-related components
  - `/components/feed/` - Feed components

#### Migration Example

The project recently migrated from a technical organization (`/components/dashboard/LeadCard.component.tsx`) to a domain-based organization (`/components/leads/LeadCard.component.tsx`). This reorganization:

1. Improved code discoverability by placing all lead-related components in one location
2. Enhanced maintainability by grouping related components
3. Established a pattern for future feature development
4. Clarified component ownership and purpose

#### Component Directory Structure

- **Layout Components:**
  - `Container.component.tsx`
- **UI Components:**
  - `Button.ui.tsx`, `Input.ui.tsx`, `Card.ui.tsx`, `Avatar.ui.tsx`, `Checkbox.ui.tsx`, `Logo.ui.tsx`, `ThemeToggle.ui.tsx`, `DecorativeElements.ui.tsx`, `CheckboxGroup.ui.tsx`, `FileUpload.ui.tsx`, `Switch.ui.tsx`, `Textarea.ui.tsx`, `Select.ui.tsx`, `AuthDivider.ui.tsx`, `GoogleButton.ui.tsx`, `BackButton.ui.tsx`
- **Feature Components:**
  - `LoginForm.component.tsx`, `LoginFormFields.component.tsx`, `LoginFormSecurity.component.tsx`, `SignUpForm.component.tsx`, `SignUpFormContent.component.tsx`, `CAAuthTabs.component.tsx`, `SearchBar.component.tsx`, `CACard.component.tsx`, `Leads.component.tsx`, `LeadCard.component.tsx`, `LeadFilter.component.tsx`, `LeadSkeleton.component.tsx`, `LeadEmptyState.component.tsx`, `RoleSelection.component.tsx`, `UserOnboardingForm.component.tsx`, `Feed.component.tsx`, `PostCard.component.tsx`, `ReactionSystem.component.tsx`, `CommentThread.component.tsx`, `CreatePost.component.tsx`, `SearchAndFilter.component.tsx`, `DashboardLayout.component.tsx`

#### Best Practices

- When adding new components, identify the business domain first, then place in the appropriate directory
- If a component is used across multiple domains, consider if it belongs in a shared directory
- Keep all tests aligned with the domain structure to maintain consistency
- Update documentation whenever domain organization changes

## 9. Development Environment & Contextual Awareness

- **Using Cursor IDE:**
  - **Context Management:** Every file should include inline comments that reference the mobile-first design philosophy and the 200-line rule.
  - **Progress Tracking:**
    - Create and continually update a `progress.md` file after each completed task or sub-task.
    - This file is critical for ensuring that work can be resumed seamlessly if interruptions occur.
- **Cursor Rules Storage:**
  - **Recommendation:**
    - After researching best practices, it is acceptable to store the Cursor rules in a dedicated Markdown file (`cursor_rules.md`) for human readability.
    - For enhanced machine parsing, consider also including a JSON configuration file (e.g., `.cursor_rules.json`) in the project root.
  - **Guidelines in the Rules File:**
    - Mobile-first design mandates.
    - Maximum of 200 lines per component.
    - Detailed instructions for updating `progress.md` after every task.
    - Consistent usage of Next.js, TailwindCSS, shadcn UI components, react-query, and phosphoricons.

_Example Entry in `cursor_rules.md` or `.cursor_rules.json`:_
Rule 1: All components must follow a mobile-first approach. Rule 2: No component should exceed 200 lines of code. Rule 3: Update progress.md after every task/sub-task with detailed context. Rule 4: Use Next.js, TailwindCSS (with the defined theme colors), shadcn UI components, react-query, and phosphoricons. ...

## 11. Profile Pages Complete Redesign (NEW - January 2025)

**OBJECTIVE**: Completely redesign and rebuild both CA and Customer profile pages from scratch following modern design principles, proper component architecture, and enhanced user experience patterns.

### 11.1 Current State Analysis

**Issues with Existing Implementation**:
- **Complex Component Architecture**: Current profile components are overly complex with poor separation of concerns
- **Inconsistent Design**: Multiple design patterns and styling approaches across different profile components
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Profile pages not properly optimized for mobile-first design
- **Code Duplication**: Redundant logic across CA and Customer profile implementations
- **Large Component Sizes**: Many components exceed the 200-line limit established in project guidelines
- **Outdated Data Flow**: Profile data fetching and state management not following current best practices
- **Accessibility Issues**: Profile pages lack proper accessibility features and semantic HTML

**Technology Debt**:
- Old component patterns not following current project standards
- Inconsistent use of Phosphor icons vs other icon libraries
- Mixed styling approaches (inline styles vs TailwindCSS classes)
- Outdated form validation and state management
- Missing TypeScript strict typing in several components

### 11.2 Redesign Principles

**Core Design Philosophy**:
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Every component designed for mobile devices first, then enhanced for larger screens
- **Component Size Limit**: Strict adherence to 200-line maximum per component
- **Modern UI Patterns**: Implement glassmorphism, gradient accents, and smooth animations
- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG AA compliance as a baseline requirement
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading, efficient re-rendering, and optimized bundle sizes

**Visual Design Standards**:
- **Vibrant Gradients**: Bold gradient backgrounds for hero sections and accent elements
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Subtle transparency and backdrop blur for modern card designs
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth hover states, micro-animations, and visual feedback
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear font size scales and consistent text styling
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using TailwindCSS spacing scale
- **Shadow Depth**: Proper shadow layering for visual hierarchy and depth perception

## 12. Database Schema Management Policy (NEW - January 2025)

**OBJECTIVE**: Establish clear guidelines for database schema changes and maintain proper versioning control for production environments.

### 12.1 DDL Change Management Policy

**Core Principle**: Once a table exists in production or shared development environments, all schema changes MUST use `ALTER` statements rather than modifying the original `CREATE` statements.

**Rationale**:
- **Production Safety**: Prevents accidental data loss in production environments
- **Version Control**: Maintains clear history of schema evolution
- **Team Collaboration**: Enables safe schema changes across multiple developers
- **Migration Tracking**: Provides clear audit trail of all database modifications
- **Rollback Capability**: Allows for easier rollback strategies when needed

### 12.2 Schema Change Implementation

**For New Features Requiring Schema Changes**:

1. **Create Migration Files**: 
   ```sql
   -- File location: src/migrations/<feature-name>-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
   -- Example: src/migrations/profile-completion-tracking-2025-01-15.sql
   ```

2. **Use ALTER Statements Only**:
   ```sql
   -- ✅ CORRECT: Adding new column
   ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
   ADD COLUMN profile_completion_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

   -- ❌ INCORRECT: Modifying CREATE statement
   -- Don't modify the original CREATE TABLE statement
   ```

3. **Include Rollback Instructions**:
   ```sql
   -- Forward migration
   ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN profile_completion_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
   
   -- Rollback (if needed)
   -- ALTER TABLE public.profiles DROP COLUMN profile_completion_percentage;
   ```

4. **Document in Progress Tracker**: All schema changes must be documented with rationale and impact assessment

### 12.3 Profile Completion Tracking Implementation

**Required Schema Addition**:
```sql
-- Add profile completion tracking to existing profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN profile_completion_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (profile_completion_percentage >= 0 AND profile_completion_percentage <= 100);

-- Add completion tracking metadata
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN last_completed_section TEXT,
ADD COLUMN completion_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now();

-- Create index for completion queries
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_completion_percentage ON public.profiles(profile_completion_percentage);

-- Create trigger to update completion timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_completion_timestamp()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF OLD.profile_completion_percentage IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.profile_completion_percentage THEN
        NEW.completion_updated_at = now();
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_completion_timestamp
    BEFORE UPDATE ON public.profiles
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_completion_timestamp();
```

**Profile Completion Calculation Logic**:
- **Basic Info**: 20% (name, email, phone, location)
- **Professional Details**: 20% (bio, specializations, languages)
- **Experience**: 20% (at least one experience entry)
- **Education**: 20% (at least one education entry)
- **Social/Contact**: 20% (at least one social link or professional website)

### 12.4 Schema Change Workflow

**Development Process**:
1. **Identify Need**: Feature requires database schema changes
2. **Create Migration File**: Write ALTER statements in migration file
3. **Test Locally**: Verify migration works on local development database
4. **Document Changes**: Update progress tracker with schema change details
5. **Peer Review**: Have schema changes reviewed before merging
6. **Apply to Staging**: Test migration on staging environment
7. **Production Deployment**: Apply migration during deployment window

**File Organization**:
```
src/migrations/
├── profile-completion-tracking-2025-01-15.sql
├── contact-request-priority-2025-01-20.sql
└── ca-verification-fields-2025-01-25.sql
```

**File Naming Convention**: `<feature-description>-YYYY-MM-DD.sql`

### 12.5 Emergency Schema Changes

**For Critical Hotfixes**:
- Emergency changes still follow ALTER statement policy
- Document rationale for emergency change
- Create proper migration file post-deployment
- Update all environments to match production schema

### 12.6 Schema Documentation Maintenance

**Requirements**:
- **Living Documentation**: Keep `database-schema.md` updated with current state
- **Change Log**: Maintain chronological log of all schema modifications
- **Version Tracking**: Tag schema versions with application releases
- **Impact Assessment**: Document performance and breaking change implications

**Benefits of This Policy**:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces chance of accidental data loss
- **Professional Standards**: Follows industry best practices for database management
- **Team Coordination**: Enables safe concurrent development
- **Production Stability**: Ensures reliable deployment processes
- **Compliance Ready**: Meets enterprise-level change management requirements

### 12.6 Index File Usage Policy

**Core Principle**: Minimize the use of index.ts files to reduce confusion and improve code clarity.

**Rationale**:
- **Import Clarity**: Direct imports are more explicit and easier to trace
- **IDE Support**: Better IntelliSense and auto-import functionality
- **Debugging**: Easier to locate actual component files during debugging
- **Maintenance**: Reduces the overhead of maintaining multiple index files
- **Bundle Analysis**: Clearer understanding of import dependencies

**Guidelines**:
1. **Avoid Index Files**: Prefer direct imports over index file re-exports
2. **Limited Usage**: Only use index files for major module boundaries (e.g., main package exports)
3. **No Nested Indexes**: Avoid creating index files within subdirectories
4. **Explicit Imports**: Use full component paths instead of index shortcuts
5. **Documentation**: When index files are necessary, document the reasoning

**Examples**:
```typescript
// PREFERRED: Direct imports
import { CAProfileHeader } from "@/components/profile/ca/CAProfileHeader.component";
import { ProfileAvatar } from "@/components/profile/shared/ProfileAvatar.component";

// AVOID: Index file shortcuts
import { CAProfileHeader } from "@/components/profile/ca";
import { ProfileAvatar } from "@/components/profile/shared";
```

**Exception Cases**:
- Main package exports (e.g., `src/ui/index.ts` for UI component library)
- External library compatibility requirements
- Large module boundaries with stable interfaces

## 13. Service Layer Architecture Patterns (NEW - January 2025)

**OBJECTIVE**: Document the established service layer architecture patterns from the leads service to ensure consistency across all future service implementations.

### 13.1 Service Architecture Analysis

**Established Patterns from leads.service.ts**:

#### **File Structure Pattern**:
```typescript
// 1. Import structure
import { supabase } from "@/helper/supabase.helper";
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useAuth } from "@/store/context/Auth.provider";
import { TypeImports } from "@/types/[domain]/[entity].type";

// 2. Core Service Functions (Pure async functions)
// 3. TanStack Query Hooks (React hooks using the core functions)
```

#### **Core Service Functions Pattern**:
- **Pure Async Functions**: No React dependencies, can be tested independently
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
- **Data Transformation**: Raw Supabase data → Application-specific interfaces
- **Complex Query Building**: Dynamic query construction based on parameters
- **Pagination Support**: Built-in pagination with metadata
- **Client-Side Processing**: Handle complex filtering/sorting when Supabase joins are problematic

#### **TanStack Query Integration Pattern**:
- **Separate Hooks for Different Operations**: `useLeads`, `useCreateEngagement`, `useHideLead`
- **Consistent Query Keys**: `["entity", userId, ...parameters]`
- **Authentication Integration**: Use `useAuth` hook for user context
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper `queryClient.invalidateQueries` on mutations
- **Error and Loading States**: Consistent return structure with `isLoading`, `isError`, `error`

### 13.2 Service Function Architecture

#### **Data Fetching Functions**:
```typescript
export const fetchEntity = async (
  userId?: string,
  filter?: EntityFilter,
  pagination?: PaginationParams,
  sort?: EntitySort
): Promise<PaginatedEntityResponse> => {
  try {
    // 1. Build Supabase query dynamically
    // 2. Apply filters and joins
    // 3. Execute query
    // 4. Transform raw data to application format
    // 5. Apply client-side processing if needed
    // 6. Calculate pagination metadata
    // 7. Return structured response
  } catch (error) {
    // Comprehensive error handling with fallback data
  }
};
```

#### **Mutation Functions**:
```typescript
const createEntity = async (data: CreateEntityData) => {
  // 1. Transform input data for database
  // 2. Execute mutation with proper error handling
  // 3. Return transformed result
};

const updateEntity = async (id: string, data: UpdateEntityData) => {
  // 1. Update with optimistic timestamps
  // 2. Handle partial updates
  // 3. Return updated entity
};
```

### 13.3 TanStack Query Hook Patterns

#### **Query Hooks**:
```typescript
export const useEntity = (filter?: EntityFilter, pagination?: PaginationParams, sort?: EntitySort) => {
  const { auth } = useAuth();

  const { data, isLoading, isError, error, refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["entity", auth.user?.id, filter, pagination, sort],
    queryFn: () => fetchEntity(auth.user?.id, filter, pagination, sort),
    enabled: !!auth.user?.id,
    staleTime: 0, // or appropriate cache time
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  });

  return {
    // Destructured data with fallbacks
    entities: data?.data || [],
    totalCount: data?.totalCount || 0,
    // ... pagination metadata
    isLoading,
    isError,
    error,
    refetch,
  };
};
```

#### **Mutation Hooks**:
```typescript
export const useCreateEntity = () => {
  const { auth } = useAuth();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const { data, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error, mutate } = useMutation({
    mutationFn: (entityData: CreateEntityData) => createEntity(entityData, auth.user?.id || ""),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["entity"] });
    },
  });

  return {
    data,
    isLoading: isPending,
    isSuccess,
    isError,
    error,
    createEntity: mutate,
  };
};
```

### 13.4 Key Implementation Principles

#### **Separation of Concerns**:
- **Core Functions**: Handle data logic, no React dependencies
- **Hooks**: Provide React integration and state management
- **Components**: Use hooks, no direct service calls

#### **Error Handling Strategy**:
- **Service Level**: Comprehensive try-catch with logging
- **Hook Level**: Pass through errors to components
- **Component Level**: Display user-friendly error messages

#### **Performance Optimization**:
- **Query Optimization**: Smart query building to avoid N+1 problems
- **Client-Side Processing**: When database queries become too complex
- **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate `staleTime` based on data volatility
- **Pagination**: Server-side with client-side metadata calculation

#### **Type Safety Requirements**:
- **Interface Definitions**: All data structures typed in separate type files
- **Response Interfaces**: Consistent paginated response structure
- **Error Types**: Proper error type definitions
- **Query Key Types**: Type-safe query key construction

### 13.5 Profile Service Implementation Guidelines

Based on the established patterns, the ProfileService should follow:

1. **Core Functions**: `fetchProfile`, `updateProfile`, `uploadProfilePicture`, `calculateProfileCompletion`
2. **Mutation Functions**: `updateBasicInfo`, `addExperience`, `updateExperience`, `deleteExperience`
3. **Query Hooks**: `useProfile`, `useExperiences`, `useEducations`, `useSocialProfile`
4. **Mutation Hooks**: `useUpdateProfile`, `useCreateExperience`, `useUpdateExperience`, `useDeleteExperience`
5. **Data Transformation**: Database schema → TypeScript interfaces
6. **Authentication Integration**: User-specific profile data fetching
7. **Cache Strategy**: Longer cache times for profile data, immediate invalidation on updates

### 13.6 Benefits of This Architecture

- **Testability**: Core functions can be unit tested independently
- **Reusability**: Service functions can be used outside of React components
- **Consistency**: Predictable patterns across all services
- **Performance**: Optimal caching and query strategies
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration throughout the stack

This architecture ensures scalable, maintainable, and performant data management across the entire application.
