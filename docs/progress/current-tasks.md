## Documentation Refactoring

### 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**: Large Documentation Modularization

**Objective**: Organize and refactor large documentation files (prd.md and progress.md) to improve readability, maintainability, and ease of processing by LLMs.

#### Current Progress ✅

**PRD Modularization** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Created docs/prd/ directory** with modular structure
- ✅ **Split prd.md into focused files**:
  - `overview.md` - Project description, goals, target audience
  - `architecture-guidelines.md` - State management and service patterns
  - `database-schema.md` - Schema management and migration policies
  - `component-standards.md` - Development standards and naming conventions
  - `ui-ux-guidelines.md` - Design system and visual guidelines
  - `testing-standards.md` - Testing strategies and coverage requirements
- ✅ **Created central README.md** with clear navigation system
- ✅ **Added quick summary sections** for each document
- ✅ **Implemented cross-linking** between related sections

**Progress Modularization** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
- ✅ **Created docs/progress/ directory structure**
- ✅ **Completed completed-features.md** with comprehensive feature catalog
- 🚧 **Working on current-tasks.md** (this file)
- ⏳ **Pending**: backlog.md for planned features
- ⏳ **Pending**: bug-fixes.md for known issues and technical debt
- ⏳ **Pending**: Central README.md for progress navigation

#### Next Steps
1. **Complete Progress Directory**: Finish current-tasks.md, create backlog.md and bug-fixes.md
2. **Create Navigation**: Central README.md for docs/progress/ directory
3. **Content Migration**: Move remaining content from original files to modular structure
4. **Validation**: Ensure all content is properly categorized and accessible
5. **Archive Original Files**: Update or archive original prd.md and progress.md
